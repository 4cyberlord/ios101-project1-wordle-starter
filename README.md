# Project 1 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Charles A. Boakye**

**Wordle** is an engaging word puzzle game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the game provides feedback using colors: green tiles indicate correct letters in the right position, yellow tiles show correct letters in the wrong position, and gray tiles represent letters that aren't in the word. This interactive and challenging game tests your vocabulary and deductive reasoning skills while providing a fresh word to solve each time you play.
